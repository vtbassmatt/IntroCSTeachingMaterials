Student implementations of a few functions go in engine.py:
- build_index
- parse_query
- search
- determine_relevance

See the docstrings for each function to learn about expected input and output.

They may use some functions from helpers.py, mostly uninteresting or too-advanced cleanup routines:
- cleanup_term
- load_document
- split_document

Search.py does the orchestration of the various parts and asks the user for their search query. Run it with argument --grade to get extended debugging output useful for grading.
